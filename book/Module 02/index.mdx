# Simulated Twins & Embodied Training

## Introduction

Digital twins - high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical robots - have revolutionized how we develop and train humanoid systems. This module explores how simulation environments enable safe, scalable training of robotic behaviors before deployment to real hardware. You'll learn to leverage Gazebo Harmonic, the latest generation of robot simulation, to create photorealistic environments for embodied AI training.

## Why Digital Twins Matter

Training humanoid robots in the physical world is expensive, time-consuming, and potentially dangerous. A single failed grasp attempt could damage a $100,000 robot hand. Digital twins solve this by providing:

- **Safe Experimentation**: Test risky behaviors without hardware damage
- **Parallel Training**: Run thousands of simulation instances simultaneously
- **Rapid Iteration**: Modify robot designs and retrain in hours, not weeks
- **Physics Validation**: Verify control algorithms before real-world deployment

## What You'll Learn

You'll start by building Gazebo worlds that mirror real-world environments - warehouses, homes, laboratories. You'll learn to model physics accurately, including friction, inertia, and contact dynamics critical for manipulation tasks.

We'll then explore sim-to-real transfer techniques that bridge the reality gap. You'll discover domain randomization strategies, sensor noise modeling, and system identification methods that ensure behaviors trained in simulation work reliably on physical robots.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will:

- Design and configure Gazebo worlds for humanoid robot training
- Implement physics-accurate sensor models (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs)
- Train reinforcement learning policies in parallel simulation instances
- Apply domain randomization to improve sim-to-real transfer
- Validate simulated behaviors through real-world experiments
